Additionally, the company wants to invest in fuel-efficient upgrades of trucks for each type of goods, which will reduce fuel costs per trip. The company has a total of 50 trucks available for the month. The total investment in fuel efficiency upgrades cannot exceed $60,000. Due to operational constraints, each truck can make no more than 20 trips in the month. The company must ensure that at least 10 trucks are allocated to GoodsX and 15 trucks to GoodsY. The fuel cost per trip for each type of goods decreases by $10 for every $10,000 invested in fuel efficiency upgrades for that type of goods. The initial fuel cost per trip for GoodsX is $200, for GoodsY is $250, and for GoodsZ is $300. The revenue generated per trip is $500 for GoodsX, $600 for GoodsY, and $700 for GoodsZ.

        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 h daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete (say, T) time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among time windows. Staff members are scheduled to n different (work) shifts, each covering m(m < T) consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window.

        "question": "To protect soil from erosion, some farmers plant winter cover crops such as winter wheat and rye. In addition to conserving soil, cover crops often increase crop yields in the row crops that follow in spring and summer. Suppose that a farmer has 800 acres of land and plans to plant winter wheat and rye. The input cost for I acre for each crop is given in the table along with the cost for machinery and labor. The profit for 1 acre of each crop is given in the last column. Input Cost per Acre, Labor/Machinery Cost per Acre, Profit per Acre. Wheat: [$90, $50, $42], Rye: [$120, $40, $35]. Suppose the farmer has budgeted a maximum of $90,000 for input costs and a maximum of $36,000 for labor and machinery. Determine the number of acres of each crop that the farmer should plant to maximize profit. (Assume that all crops will be sold.). What is the maximum profit? If the profit per acre for wheat were $40 and the profit per acre for rye were $45, how many acres of each crop should be planted to maximize profit?",

The actual cutting of the wood takes 30 minutes. Assembling includes sewing of the fabric and the attachment of rivets, screws, fabric, and dowel rods, and takes 45 minutes. The finishing stage involves sanding, staining, and varnishing of the various parts and takes one hour. Adirondack chairs take two hours for both the cutting and assembling phases. and finishing takes one hour.

The densely-seated ski lift uses 30 units of electricity and the loosely-seated lift uses 22 units of electricity. There must be at least five loosely-seated ski lifts because they move slower and are friendlier for beginners.

The initial profit per unit of ProductB is $70, and with automation, the profit increases by $7 per unit for every $100 invested in automation. The initial profit per unit of ProductC is $60, and with automation, the profit increases by $6 per unit for every $100 invested in automation. The company aims to maximize the total profit from all products. The production cost for ProductA is $10 per unit, the production cost for ProductB is $15 per unit, and the production cost for ProductC is $20 per unit. The company has a total budget of $50,000 for production and automation investments. The production capacity for the next month is limited to 1,000 units in total. Due to market demand, the company must produce at least 100 units of ProductA and 150 units of ProductB.

In addition, the candy counter will offer individual one-pound boxes of cashews, raisins, caramels, and chocolates.

DMC is able to buy 100 rollers per week, and it has 160 hours of gear cutting time and 40 hours of polishing time available per week. To avoid harming long-term sales, DMC does not want to raise prices. At current prices DMC will earn a profit of DM24,000 on each four-color press made and DM10,000 on each two-color press made. So as not to abandon either product market, DMC also wants to produce at least two units of each press each week. Maximize its profit.",

        "question": "The Office of Nutrition Inspection of the EU recently found out that dishes served at the dining and beverage facility \"Bullneck's\" such  as herring, hot dogs, and house-style hamburgers do not comport with the new nutritional regulations, and its report mentioned explicitly the lack of vitamins A and C and dietary fiber. The owner and operator of the facility is attempting to rectify these shortcomings by augmenting the menu with vegetable side dishes, which he intends to create from white cabbage, carrots, and a stockpile of pickled cucumbers discovered in the cellar. The following table summarizes the numerical data: the prescribed amount of the vitamins and fiber per dish, their content in the foods, and the unit prices of the foods. For example, Carrot Raw contains 35 mg/kg Vitamin A, 60 mg/kg Vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 30 g/kg as the praise is 0.75 and it's required per dish 0.5mg. For White Cabbage, Raw contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 300 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 20 g/kg as the praise is 0.5 and it's required per dish 15mg. For Cucumber, Pickled contains 0.5 mg/kg vitamin A, 10 mg/kg vitamin C, and Dietary Fiber 10 g/kg as the praise is 0.15 and it's required per dish 4g. The objective function expresses the price of the combination. At what minimum additional price per dish can the requirements of the Office of Nutrition Inspection be satisfied?",

        "question": "Many companies or institutions, especially those operating 24 hours daily, usually divide the daily schedule into discrete time windows. Examples include hospitals, restaurants, call centers, and police departments. The number of staff required typically varies among these time windows. Staff members are scheduled to work different shifts, each covering a certain number of consecutive time windows. Staff members assigned to different shifts may be paid differently, depending on which shift they work. For example, those working overnight are usually paid at a higher rate. The scheduling problem is to determine the number of workers to be assigned to each shift so that the company meets the demand in each time window. Consider a 24-hour fast food restaurant that operates in eight consecutive time windows, each of 3 hours duration. A shift covers three consecutive time windows (9 hours in total).
